Living in California, it is essential to prepare for future earthquakes. "An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities.(Wikipedia)". You can prepare by first making a plan for your household. Identify places to take cover, and teach people signals for help. Practice "drop, cover, and hold on". Identify out-of-building areas, turn off home utilities, write down emergency contacts. Also, make an emergency earthquake kit containing the following: 

1. 3 days worth of non-perishable, salted, or canned food 

2. Flashlights and a radio, with extra batteries 

3. A first aid kit 

4. A basic tool kit 

5. Water (one gallon per person for at least 3 days)

With these tips, you can be better prepared for when an earthquake strikes.
